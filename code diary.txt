okay. decided to start over and make a DbC framework. 
this get much closer to the most important aspect of my idea.
I'm gonna dive into this and see what I can build on 7 litres of coffee.

wrote a crude start on a Contract class. kinda following rdbc. 

next: try with Contracts as Modules.

#make contracts modules... 
#then you can include them... 
#and include multiple sub contracts
#inherit compile time code

hmm. looks like Contracts will have to be a class anyway...

okay, this is coming along.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

it's looking like I'll have to use evals instead of blocks.
	1. be able to change the binding...
	2. check the code for naughtyness (security)
	3. print it out if I want to.


okay, a bit of trouble feeding context through to next post step. 
but I got it working... 
it's complicated by having a decorator which pretends to be the contracted object.

but I got it to work passing a hash through... that gives the procs the weird syntax of refuring to variables like self[:name] = whatever.

instead, i'll use a context class which has @object and @pre_conditions and @post_conditions 

wow! got it working. 
testing and tidying tomorrow 
and add eval to message... that way can customize the message to give good debuging information!

need a way to verify the contract for initialization.

okay, refactored pre and post methods to use the same methods and differ only on symbols.

NEXT: is test framework to process examples for contracts and report on coverage... + and - examples. 
report on which:
	- methods don't have contracts
	- contracts don't have +/- examples.

on the horizon:
	way to process exception contracts.

okay, contracts are coming along. I can think of a few ways to make examples dryer, 
maybe write contract clauses along with examples, in a TDD style.

wrote more of the contract for array, but there is a lot of work there. 
it might be more important to write contracts for contracts, conditions, etc.

and then implement
copule(contract) --> returns a class which abides by contract.
i.e. so you can use
couple(:ArrayContract).new
instead of 
Array.new
