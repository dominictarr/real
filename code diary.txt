okay. decided to start over and make a DbC framework. 
this get much closer to the most important aspect of my idea.
I'm gonna dive into this and see what I can build on 7 litres of coffee.

wrote a crude start on a Contract class. kinda following rdbc. 

next: try with Contracts as Modules.

#make contracts modules... 
#then you can include them... 
#and include multiple sub contracts
#inherit compile time code

hmm. looks like Contracts will have to be a class anyway... ruby c
